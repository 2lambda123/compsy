    "## Why use a virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "A *virtual environment* creates a folder that contains all of the libraries and code necessary to use the packages needed by a specific project. \n",
    "- Virtual environments allow the user to have different versions of the same package on the same system. \n",
    "- This is important because some packages are only compatible with early versions of other packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  - Assume you have two packages you want to install on your machine, Package A and Package B\n",
    "    - Package A and Package B are both dependent on the same package, Package C\n",
    "    - Package A only works with version 1.1.19 or earlier of Package C\n",
    "    - Package B only works with version 1.2.1 or later of Package C\n",
    "\n",
    "  - If a user were to attempt to install both versions of Package C in the same environment (so they could use Package A and Package B) and a script calls a function from Package C, then the package manager would have conflicting versions of Package C that could lead to unexpected behavior invalidating the results of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - With the virtual environment approach, the user can make a separate virtual environment to accommodate the two conflicting but necessary versions of Package C. \n",
    "    - In one environment, the user can install Package A and version 1.1.19 of Package C.\n",
    "    - In the other environment, the user can install Package B and version 1.2.1 of Package C.\n",
    "    - No conflicts!\n",

    "## Creating a virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we want to create a virtual environment that we will use for the rest of the semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Download the environment.yml file from the course [GitHub](https://github.com/compmem/compsy).\n",
    "1. Open your Anaconda prompt (or Terminal in OSX/linux).\n",
    "2. Type \n",
    "   `conda create -n compsy scipy matplotlib pandas seaborn`\n",
    "   in your Anaconda Prompt.\n",
    "    - This command creates a new virtual environment separate from the base environment and installs all the packages\n",
    "3. After some time (it can take 5 to 15 minutes depending on your computer), you will see the following lines (it may also show lots of packages getting downloaded): \n",
    "***\n",
    "    Collecting package metadata <repodata.json>: done  \n",
    "    Solving environment: done  \n",
    "    Preparing transaction: done  \n",
    "    Verifying transaction: done  \n",
    "    Executing transaction: done  \n",
    "***\n",
    "4. You have now created a virtual environment\n",
    "5. To activate your virtual environment, type `conda activate compsy`\n",
    "    - This command switches you from your `base` environment to `compsy`\n",
    "    - You will then see `(compsy)` to the left of your current directory in the command prompt.\n",
    "    - Note, you may get an error saying you need to initialize your shell to use `conda activate`. If so, it will provide instructions for what you should do. Usually it is simply running the command: `conda init bash` followed by reopening your Anaconda Prompt or Terminal.\n",
    "6. When you are done working in the environment, you can type: `conda deactivate`\n"
